# Wonderful Forgotten Women

I co-produced Wonderful Forgotten Women, a one woman cabaret highlighting women throughout history who have been forgotten from the history books through drag, song and dance, performed by drag artist H.R.H Aphrodite I. 

This debuted in the Rose Theatre at Rose Bruford Symposium 2022 and excerpts have been performed at Duckie in Vauxhall Tavern.
