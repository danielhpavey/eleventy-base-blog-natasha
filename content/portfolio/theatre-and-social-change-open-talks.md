# Theatre and Social Change Open Talks

I co-produced the Theatre and Social Change Open Talks at Lewisham College and Rose Bruford College in October and December 2021. 

This is a series of live talks and a recorded podcast where emerging artists and activists talk to producers, artists, creatives, activists pioneering social change in the arts and culture sector and the wider world today. 

I was tech liaison at the live events and podcast manager for the recorded podcast following the live event series. 

I co-hosted the second Open Talk in the series, interviewing activist and journalist, Ben Smoke. [You can listen here: 1:2 Ben Smoke And The Stansted 15 - RBC TSC](https://soundcloud.com/rosebrufordtsc/12-ben-smoke-and-the-stansted-15?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)
