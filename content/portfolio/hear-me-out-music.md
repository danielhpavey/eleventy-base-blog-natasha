# Hear Me Out Music

Between January and May 2023, I completed a five month work placement at Hear Me Out Music. Hear Me Out (previously Music in Detention), are a music and migrant justice charity based in Shoreditch. 

Hear Me Out take music into UK immigration detention facilities and platform artists with lived experience of immigration detention. I got an insight into a variety of roles across the organisation such as assisting with artist support, being a liaison between participants and staff, working with migrants who have unsettled status in a variety of environments. I also supported the planning and evaluation of the Hear Me Out band gig in January 2023 at Amersham Arms in South East London. A brilliant evening of original music and raising awareness of immigration detention.
