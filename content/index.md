Natasha Pavey (she/her) is an early career theatre maker, creative producer and climate justice activist from the South West. 

She has been organising within the climate movement from a young age, from confronting politicians about the need for a Green New Deal to leading a local movement of young people to strike from school. 

In her creative work, she strives to combine both her climate activism and her training in theatre as a tool for change. 

She is soon to graduate from BA (Hons) Theatre and Social Change at Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance in London.
