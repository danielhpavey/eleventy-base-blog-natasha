Hi, I'm Tash (she/her) ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 22 year old theatre maker, creative producer and climate justice activist from the South West. 

I recently graduated with a first class degree in BA (Hons) Theatre and Social Change from Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance in June 2023. And soon after took up my role as Artist for Change, Climate Emergency at the Theatre Royal Plymouth in my home county of Devon in July. A new year long position supported by the Jerwood Developing Artists Fund. 

At 16, I started fighting for a liveable future. I co-founded my local youth climate strike group, Fridays For Future Exeter and joined a global movement of young people through building a local movement that created the biggest peaceful protest the South West of England has ever seen with 3500+ occupying the streets of Exeter in September 2019. I have since gone on to organise and take non violent direct action with a myriad of groups across the UK climate movement such as Extinction Rebellion, Teach the Future, People and Planet, Green New Deal Rising, Force of Nature and more. From confronting politicians about the need for a Green New Deal to leading a local movement of young people to strike from school, I grew up in the climate movement.

In my creative work, I strive to combine both my climate activism and my love for theatre as tool for change and to hold the creative industries responsible for their part to play in the climate emergency. I am an organiser with the Green Captains (the youth board of the Theatre Green Book and the UK alternative to the Broadway Green Alliance) and the Equity for a Green New Deal Sustainable Theatre working group.
