# About Me

I am a **creative producer, theatre maker** and **climate justice campaigner**. I am an enthusiastic, dedicated early career producer with a background in performing arts but I have recently found a love for producing and programming. I am currently in my final year studying BA (Hons) Theatre & Social Change at Rose Bruford College in London but I am originally based in the South West.

As the co-founder of Fridays For Future Exeter, I have been campaigning for Climate Justice and Education since the age of 16. Currently, I am an activist with Teach the Future, working on the first ever student written bill, Green New Deal Rising, putting pressure on politicians to pick a side and People & Planet, lobbying Rose Bruford College to become the first specialist drama school in the UK to reject the fossil fuel and border industries. Finding my place in an ever growing movement, I have met and worked with activists from across the globe and have even joined activists organising on the streets at the G7 Summit in Cornwall and COP26 in Glasgow.

In the arts, I strive to bring these two passions together. I am an organiser with Equity 4 a Green New Deal and the Theatre Green Captains scheme (in collaboration with the ABTT Sustainability Committee and inspired by the Theatre Green Book). In my performance practice, I am currently co-writing ‘The Planet Is…’ under the mentorship of Bryony Kimmings. This is an original two person verbatim musical detailing the lives of two young climate activists navigating a movement that’s being stripped of the right to protest.

I have extensive skills in performance (theatre, live art, dance and music), marketing, facilitation, communications, content creation, youth engagement, political organisation, de-escalation, working with a budget, event planning, management and team/ movement building.

## Mission Statement:

I strongly believe that we, as artists and producers, have a massive role to play in the climate emergency. Media and structures of political power are failing us. I have experienced the arts to be a place to express anger and anxiety around this but also a place to find collective joy and hope. I’m grateful that I’ve had access to the arts to pull me out of low moments. I aspire to share this hope with others, ensure everyone has access to this and to equally turn this hope into action. I’ve seen it happen. I’ve helped initiate this change. I pride myself in pushing boundaries as an activist to encourage creative industries to take responsibility for their part to play. I will continue to dedicate myself and my career to doing this.
