# About Me

I am a **creative producer, theatre maker** and **climate justice campaigner**. I am an enthusiastic, dedicated early career producer with a background in performing arts but I have recently found a love for producing and programming. I am currently in my final year studying BA (Hons) Theatre & Social Change at Rose Bruford College in London but I am originally based in the South West.

As the co-founder of Fridays For Future Exeter, I have been campaigning for Climate Justice and Education since the age of 16. Currently, I am an activist with Teach the Future, working on the first ever student written bill, Green New Deal Rising, putting pressure on politicians to pick a side and People & Planet, lobbying Rose Bruford College to become the first specialist drama school in the UK to reject the fossil fuel and border industries. Finding my place in an ever growing movement, I have met and worked with activists from across the globe and have even joined activists organising on the streets at the G7 Summit in Cornwall and COP26 in Glasgow.

In the arts, I strive to bring these two passions together. I am an organiser with Equity 4 a Green New Deal and co-run the Theatre Green Captains scheme in collaboration with the ABTT Sustainability Committee and parented by the Theatre Green Book. In my performance practice, I am currently co-writing ‘The Planet Is…’ under the mentorship of Bryony Kimmings. This is an original two person verbatim musical detailing the lives of two young climate activists navigating a movement that’s being stripped of the right to protest.

I have extensive skills in performance (theatre, live art, dance and music), marketing, facilitation, communications, content creation, youth engagement, political organisation, de-escalation, working with a budget, event planning, management and team/ movement building.
