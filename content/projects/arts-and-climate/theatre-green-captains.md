# Theatre Green Captains

I am an active member of the Theatre Green Captains scheme in collaboration with the ABTT Sustainability Committee and in connection with the Theatre Green Book. 

The Green Captains is a group run by students and young practitioners in theatre. We are a network of young artivists, who meet virtually to share ideas, ask for advice, sharing resources to push for more sustainable practices in our industry and education. 

Similarly, in the US, the [Broadway Green Alliance](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadwaygreen.com%2Fabout-us&data=05%7C01%7C2001053%40bruford.ac.uk%7C5c46603ee7f040a127bc08db1a2ab131%7C571e9021d3ff41bd81aa4c24c816f7d5%7C0%7C0%7C638132542885219354%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=dCuk3JGNzvegsy0qRSUo%2BI02dZ9RhZ5G8ZRdlGtW5Zc%3D&reserved=0) has paved the way for an initiative dedicated to educating and inspiring producing theatres to implement environmentally friendlier practices, with their Green Captain programme providing advocacy and support for professional theatres and college theatre departments.

We hope to continue to build our network in the UK, collaborating with arts and educational institutions.
