# Equity4GND

I am an organiser with Equity 4 a Green New Deal joining monthly meetings with union members across the country, working together to find commonality in our workplaces and practices so that we can take collective action and organise within the union to be a more environmentally sustainable industry. Recently, Equity 4 a Green New Deal has been working on divesting our pension scheme, being in conversations around the Theatre Green Book and have passed a motion to make The Green Rider Equity Policy.Â
