# Exeter College Student Union

During my time studying at Exeter College, I was elected as the Communication Officer of the Exeter College Student Union from 2019 to 2020. This year-long position consisted of creating an online presence to engage with over 10,000 students college wide, support and run events to enhance the student experience and liaise with staff, senior management and governors to act on feedback from peers and classmates. I prioritised sustainability throughout the role and used my platform to initiate conversation around climate in spaces of power.

My highlights include collaborating with TOTUM and NUS to create a local student focussed online advertisement campaign and organising a pop up events encouraging students to vote in response to young people having the lowest voter turnout.
