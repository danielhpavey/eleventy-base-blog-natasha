# People & Planet

In 2022, I joined the higher education divestment movement. I spent a year lobbying Rose Bruford to become [the first specialist drama school in the UK to reject the fossil fuel industry by signing the People & Planet Fossil Free Declaration](https://peopleandplanet.org/blog/2022-08-17/press-release-rose-bruford-college-uk%E2%80%99s-first-drama-school-reject-fossil-fuel), joining over a 100 universities and higher education institutions across the country to do so.

Following this, I founded the Rose Bruford People & Planet Society, building a team of like minded students to join People & Planets Divest Borders campaign, [lobbying Rose Bruford to reject the Border Industries next](https://bright-green.org/2022/10/19/drama-schools-like-rose-bruford-must-keep-our-money-out-of-the-border-industry/). [With the support of People and Planet and on campus campaigns across the country](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj4yWRDjxmy/), we want [Rose Bruford to sign the Divest Borders Declaration in solidarity with frontline activists standing up against the UK hostile environment, fighting for migrant justice, and compassion and respect for people seeking safety.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpx3UhiKxVA/)

Recently, [we joined campaigners across the country in a National Day of Action](https://www.instagram.com/p/Co0F9llD60x/), projecting the words 'Destroy Walls Not The Planetâ€™ across campus.
