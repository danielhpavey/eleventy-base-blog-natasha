# Extinction Rebellion

I have been involved with Extinction Rebellion in my hometown of Exeter since 2018. From supporting with social media and actions to founding a youth branch and new affinity groups, Extinction Rebellion has formed the foundation of my grassroots organising.

In Exeter, highlights include [calling out high street banks funded by dirty fossil fuels](https://twitter.com/natashapaveyuk/status/1586644129584406528?s=20) and [reading testimonies from women in the global south on the frontlines of natural disasters on Exeter Quay.Â ](https://twitter.com/natashapaveyuk/status/1300132565580382209?s=20)

I joined XR South West at the G7 Summit in Cornwall in June 2021 and [at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWL4nGbjnaU/)
