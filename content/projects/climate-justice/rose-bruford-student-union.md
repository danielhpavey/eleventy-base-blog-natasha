# Rose Bruford Student Union

I was elected as the Environment and Ethics Officers of the Rose Bruford Student Union from 2021 to 2022. Throughout my role, I vouched for climate and sustainability on campus from positive changes across on ground to creating student networks and pushing for environmental focusses policies on committees and at a senior management level. My highlights include pushing for more sustainable catering on campus with Plant Based Universities and lobbying Rose Bruford to become the first specialist drama school in the country to reject the fossil fuel industry with People & Planet.
