# Rose Bruford Student Union

I was elected as the Environment and Ethics Officer of the Rose Bruford Student Union from 2021 to 2022. Throughout my role, I vouched for climate and sustainability on campus from positive changes on the ground to creating student networks and pushing for environmental focussed policies on committees and at a senior management level. My highlights include advocating for more sustainable catering on campus with [Plant Based Universities](https://www.plantbaseduniversities.org/) and lobbying Rose Bruford to become the first specialist drama school in the country to reject the fossil fuel industry with [People & Planet](https://peopleandplanet.org/blog/2022-08-17/press-release-rose-bruford-college-uk%E2%80%99s-first-drama-school-reject-fossil-fuel).
