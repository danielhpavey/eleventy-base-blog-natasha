# Green New Deal Rising

I have been an organiser with Green New Deal Rising since October 2021. I have taken on a variety of roles across the movement such as canvassing to inspire other young people to join the movement, phone banking in support of Green New Deal champions parliamentary campaigns, planning actions with the reactive actions team, confronting MPs about the need for climate and migrant justice and facilitating trainings, teaching other young people how to challenge those in power.

A few of my highlights with Green New Deal Rising include being a spokesperson for the campaign in a variety of formats such as [filming a campaign video which breaks down the GND for supporters online](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgCSRbCjyGJ/), [standing in solidarity nurses and workers on strike on the picket lines](https://twitter.com/natashapaveyuk/status/1603361678783021061?s=20), [organising and representing the movement at local Green New Deal events to mobilise on a local scale in Devon](https://twitter.com/GNDUK_devon/status/1642137587040100352?s=20), confronting MPs such as [Minister of State for Immigration, Robert Jenrick making it into national headlines](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/09/activists-infiltrate-tory-event-to-protest-over-missing-asylum-seeking-children?CMP=share_btn_tw) in February 2023, [disrupting a HM Treasury event to call out the Government on the cost of living crisis](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd_jmdMjd0M/) in May 2022 and [asking MP Kevin Foster if heâ€™ll back the Green New Deal at Exeter University](https://twitter.com/natashapaveyuk/status/1504393137589997568?s=20) in March 2022.
