# Green New Deal Rising

I have been a volunteer organiser since early 2022. I have taken on a variety of roles across the movement such a being a member of the calling team, phone banking to grow our movement and support Green New Deal champion in their parliamentary campaigns, the reactive actions team, confronting MPs about the need for climate and migrant justice and the training team, facilitating trainings to teach other young people to confront politicians to back the Green New Deal Bill. 

A few of my highlights with Green New Deal Rising include being a spokesperson for the campaign in a variety of formats such as [filming a campaign video which breaks down the GND for supporters online](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgCSRbCjyGJ/), [standing in solidarity nurses and workers on strike on the picket lines](https://twitter.com/natashapaveyuk/status/1603361678783021061?s=20), [organising and representing the movement at local Green New Deal events to mobilise on a local scale in Devon](https://twitter.com/GNDUK_devon/status/1642137587040100352?s=20), confronting MPs such as [Minister of State for Immigration, Robert Jenrick making it into national headlines](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/09/activists-infiltrate-tory-event-to-protest-over-missing-asylum-seeking-children?CMP=share_btn_tw) in February 2023, [disrupting a HM Treasury event to call out the Government on the cost of living crisis](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd_jmdMjd0M/) in May 2022 and [asking MP Kevin Foster if he’ll back the Green New Deal at Exeter University](https://twitter.com/natashapaveyuk/status/1504393137589997568?s=20) in March 2022.
