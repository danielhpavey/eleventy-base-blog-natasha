# Tramshed Found Arts Festival

I completed a two month work placement with The Tramshed Theatre in Woolwich in March 2022. 

I took on the role of Festival Assistant at the Found Arts Festival, a festival for emerging artists in Greenwich and Lewisham with workshops and performances by emerging artists.

I supported the design, marketing, curation and evaluation of the festival, creating a new feedback process and joining discussions around increasing audience engagement within a local community.
