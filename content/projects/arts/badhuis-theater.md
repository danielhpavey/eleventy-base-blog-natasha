# Badhuis Theater

Between July and August 2022, I spent a month living and working in Amsterdam on placement at Badhuis Theater through the Turing scheme. 

I got involved across the theatre supporting children activities, music nights, working the bar and supporting the programming and dramaturgy of upcoming work, getting an insight into the day to day running of an international arts venue.
