# Wide Awake

During my time at Exeter College, I was one of a handful of students selected to be in the Performing Arts Academy, an extra curricula scheme offering workshops and mentoring from creatives working in different avenues in the arts industry. We worked with local director and creative, Katie Villa to create a devised performance called Wide Awake about protest and the next generation in March 2020. I wrote and performed an original spoken words piece detailing my experiences growing up as a youth climate justice activist.
