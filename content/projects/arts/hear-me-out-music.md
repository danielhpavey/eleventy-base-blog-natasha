# Hear Me Out Music

I worked at Hear Me Out Music, a music and migrant justice charity based in Shoreditch on a five month placement between January and May 2023. 

They take music into UK immigration detention facilities and platform artists with lived experience of immigration detention. I worked on artist support being a liaison between musicians and the organisation, working with refugees who have unsettled status in a variety of environments. 

Iâ€™m also grateful to have been involved with the planning and evaluation of the Hear Me Out band gig at Amersham in South East London in January 2023, a brilliant evening of original music and raising awareness of immigration detention.
