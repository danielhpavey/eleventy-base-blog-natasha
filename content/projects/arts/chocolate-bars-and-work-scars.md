# Chocolate Bars and Work Scars

As part of my studies on BA (Hons) Theatre and Social Change, I worked with Theatre of the Oppressed practitioner and director Tony Cealey to co- devise Chocolate Bars and Work Scars. 

This forum theatre inspired play was a reaction to the needs and struggles of our drama school community, addressing burnout, lack of recognition and unfair workloads in arts education. 

I portrayed Christine, a stage management student buckling under the pressure of both family and educational needs. We filmed an introductory short film and used online media to our advantage moving the performance to a virtual setting due to the pandemic, instead creating a post-mortem, an interactive virtual version of the devised performance.
