# The Planet Is___

I’m currently co-writing and producing a new verbatim musical with friend and colleague, [Meg McGrady](https://www.megmcgrady.co.uk/theplanetis). The Planet Is___ will debut at Rose Bruford College’s Grab the Mic Festival on May 19th with the hopes of further development, taking it to the doorsteps of those in power.

‘It’s the 29th June 2022, the day after the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill has come into effect. Meg and Tash, two young climate activists, decide to document how protest is affected in the next year. A lot can happen in a year. This is their story. 

‘The Planet Is _____’ is a verbatim musical about climate justice, what it means to be an activist, and the state of politics in the UK. Written by Natasha Pavey and Meg McGrady, the show has been created from words spoken and poetry written in the last year. ‘

Come and see the debut in May! ([Tickets Here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/grab-the-mic-sharings-from-emerging-artists-tickets-612370305067))
