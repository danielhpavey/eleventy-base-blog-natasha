# Wow Festival Exeter

I was a youth volunteer (Wowser) at the 2017 Women of the World Festival (WOW) in Exeter. 

We curated our own social engagement project throughout the festival, raising awareness of everyday sexism through gathering sassy comebacks to comments we had heard and sharing these at the festival closing ceremony. 

I also co-wrote and performed an original song, a teenage anthem, calling out gender based stereotypes that hold us back. I wrote a guest blog for a local online media platform, represented the festival in an interview on BBC News and joined the WOW Schools day, being a role model to younger female students.
