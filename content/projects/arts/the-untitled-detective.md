# The Untitled Detective

I produced and production managed a scratch performance of The Untitled Detective in April 2022 at Rose Bruford College. 

The Untitled Detective is an original play written by Alexander Cox about the experiences of a care experienced young person, written by a young person by a care experienced young person. 

This was such an exciting story to produce and one Iâ€™m passionate about platforming as I have close family with experience of the care system and know that there is a lack of representation of these stories in the arts.
