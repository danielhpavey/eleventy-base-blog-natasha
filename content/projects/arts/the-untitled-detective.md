# The Untitled Detective

In April 2022, I produced and production managed a scratch performance of The Untitled Detective at Rose Bruford College’s Symposium. 

The Untitled Detective is an original play written by Alexander Cox about the experiences of a care experienced young person, written and directed by a care experienced young person.

This was such an exciting story to produce and one I’m passionate about platforming as I have close family with experience of the care system and know that there is a lack of representation of these stories in the arts.
