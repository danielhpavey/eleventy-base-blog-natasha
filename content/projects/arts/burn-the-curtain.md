# Burn the Curtain

I have worked with Devon based theatre company, Burn the Curtain, on a variety of projects as their marketing assistant. 

They create accessible outdoor theatre bringing creativity to Devon's favourite green spaces. This requires me to work collaboratively to platform local creatives in press, media and online content. 

I was the marketing assistant on the 2022 and 2021 ‘The Imaginarium of Us’ and 2022 ‘Wonderous Ramblings’ projects.
