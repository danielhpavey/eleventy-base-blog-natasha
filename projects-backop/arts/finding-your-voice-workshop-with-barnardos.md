# Finding Your Voice Workshop with Barnardos

In 2021, I ran a workshop with care experienced young people and care leavers in collaboration with Barnardo’s in Brent, a final assessment for my Group Facilitation module studying BA (Hons) Theatre & Social Change. 

This workshop was called, ‘Finding Your Voice: an introduction to spoken word’ and aimed to give the young people a creative outlet to platform their voices and stories. 

It was a brilliant experience with many participants walking away with new tools and inspirational pieces which they hope to develop.
