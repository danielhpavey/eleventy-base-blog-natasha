# Earth's Last Children

In 2022, I co-devised Earth’s Last Children, directed by Izzy Rabey and performed in Rose Bruford’s Rose Theatre. Earth’s Last Children; a birthday party worth dying for is a post-apocalyptic weimar cabaret inspired one act play in which I portrayed ‘Cat Astrophe’ performing an original spoken word piece about climate breakdown, childhood and my experiences as a climate justice activist.
