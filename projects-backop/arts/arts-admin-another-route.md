# Arts Admin Another Route

I completed a two month work placement with Arts Admin in June 2022 supporting their Another Route Fellowship. 

Another Route is a new artistic fellowship that will enable a group of performance makers to embark upon a remarkable journey to internationalise their creative practice through a sensitively curated 18-month programme of events and residencies taking place across the world. 

I assisted with the producing of the first artist lab, a weekend of workshops and conversations at Hawkwood College in Stroud. I liased with artists and mentors and supported with accessibility needs and content creation.
