# Exeter College Student Union

During my time studying at Exeter College, I was elected as the Communications Officer of the Exeter College Student Union from 2019 to 2020. This year-long position consisted of creating an online presence for the SU to engage with over 10,000 students college-wide, supporting and running events to enhance the student experience and liaising with staff, senior management and Governors to act on feedback from peers and classmates. I prioritised sustainability throughout my role and used my platform to initiate conversations around climate and inclusivity in spaces of power.

My highlights include collaborating with TOTUM and NUS to create a local student-focussed online advertisement campaign and organising pop up events encouraging further education students to register to vote.
