# Fridays for Future Exeter

In 2018, at 16 years old, I co-founded my local youth climate strike group in Exeter, Fridays for Future Exeter. We joined the nationwide UK Student Climate Network and the global Fridays For Future movement. 

It started with two of us in our college cafe and grew to produce the largest peaceful protest the South West of England has ever seen with 3000+ occupying the streets of Exeter in September 2020. 

I coordinated the social media and communications for the group, liaised with local organisations, community groups and police, outreached across the county building a team of conscientious teen organisers. 

I regularly spoke to press, MPs and local politicians, facilitated meetings, fundraised for equipment and learnt many skills in de-escalation, thinking on the spot, delegation, decision making, time management, leadership and feeling the fear but doing it anyway! This will always be one of my proudest achievements and being thrown into a whirlwind after one determined 'yes' over coffee arguably taught me everything I know.

I began my journey as a climate justice activist with Fridays For Future and I haven’t stopped since!
